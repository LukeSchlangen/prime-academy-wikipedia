'''Prime Digital Academy''' (often referred to as Prime Academy, or simply Prime) is a [[computer programming]] and [[user experience design]] school, founded by Mark Hurlburt '''+++and more?+++''' in '''+++YEAR+++'''. Prime's campus is located in the [[Minneapolis Grain Exchange]] building in Downtown [[Minneapolis]]. Previously, the campus was located in [[Bloomington, Minnesota|Bloomington, MN]].

==History==

Prime was founded in '''+++YEAR+++'''' to meet a need within the industry. Prime's founders worked for [[The Nerdery]] — a software development house in Bloomington, MN — and were having trouble finding qualified talent within the Twin Cities area. The idea of creating a school was discussed as early as '''+++YEAR+++''', and actual work toward opening the school began in '''+++YEAR+++'''.

==Courses==

===Full-Stack Web Development===

Prime began by offering courses in full-stack web development. The curriculum was and still is tailored and adapted to match the industry's current needs.

===UX Design===

In 2017, Prime started offering a course track in UX Design. This pilot program was led by Ange Wang — an already experienced UX designer and educator — and started with a class of +++AMOUNT+++ students.

A space was rented nextdoor to [[The Nerdery]].

===Seminars===

In 2018, Prime began offering short seminars, currently offered only to alumni.

Seminars currently completed or planned:

- Game Design with Unity
- iOS

==Cohort Names==

The full-stack web development and UX design programs follow different naming schemes.

===Full-Stack Web Development Naming Scheme===

From the beginning, cohorts have been named after the letters of the Greek alphabet (starting with Beta). After running out of Greek letters to use, naming switched to celestial bodies.

===UX Design Naming Scheme===

For the UX Design program, the cohort names are taken from the [[Telephone_exchange_names#Standardization|Telephone exchange name standardization list]] created by AT&T in 1955. Currently known cohort names are as follows.

{| class=wikitable
	|-
	! Cohort Name

==Tech Industry Impact==

Prime Academy graduates have gone on to work for many different companies in the Twin Cities, including [[C. H. Robinson|C.H. Robinson]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Best Buy]], '''***MORE***'''
